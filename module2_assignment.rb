# Implement the following read-only attributes in the Solution class.
  #* highest_count_across_lines - a number with the value of the highest frequency of a word
  #* highest_count_words_across_lines - an array with the words with the highest frequency

  # Implement the following methods in the Solution class.
  #* analyze_file() - processes 'test.txt' intro an array of LineAnalyzers
  #* calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines which line of
  #text has the highest number of occurrence of a single word
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the words with the 
  #highest number of occurrences and their count
  
  # Implement the analyze_file() method() to:
  #* Read the 'test.txt' file in lines 
  #* Create an array of LineAnalyzers for each line in the file

  # Implement the calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the highest number of occurences of a word across all lines
  #and stores this result in the highest_count_across_lines attribute.
  #* identifies the words that were used with the highest number of occurrences
  #and stores them in print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines.

  #Implement the print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() method to
  #* print the result in the following format
